            <h3 class="mb-3">Jimmy's Apartments offers a modern living concept - contactless, secure, flexible.</h3>
            <p class="text-center mb-5">We have grown with the challenges of the last year and have therefore introduced  a contactless check-in system. This is also the reason why you will not find a classic reception at Jimmy's Apartments. Therefore, <span class="bold">payment on site is not possible.</span></p>
        </div>

        <h3>What does this mean for you?</h3>
        <p>Booking, payment and registration are already done in advance online. This eliminates the classic check-in at a reception desk and a check-out is no longer necessary. You save time, minimise contacts and enjoy a flexible stay.</p>
        <h3>What happens now?</h3>
        <p class="mb-0"><i>Things you can do directly after your booking.</i></p>
        <p>Shortly after your booking, you will receive an email from us with a link to update your contact details, the registration form and where you upload your proof of your status “tested – vaccinated – recovered” <span class="bold">3G proof</span>.</p>
        <h3>Registration & Payment</h3>
        <ul class="mb-5">Please complete the following data under the link provided in the e-mail:
            <li>Credit card verification</li>
            <li>E-mail address</li>
            <li>Telephone number</li>
            <li>Registration form (separate link in the e-mail)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have chosen the option "payment at the hotel" during the booking process, you will need to provide your credit card details and verify this credit card online (payment on site is not possible). Our flexible cancellation policy (free cancellation up to 3 days before arrival) still applies: We will charge your credit card at the earliest 3 days prior to arrival.</p>

        <h2 class="blue text-center mb-5">Jimmy's Apartments Concept & Covid-19 Guide<br><span class="regular">(as of 22. Juli 21)</span></h2>

        <p class="mb-0">Currently a stay is only permitted when adhering to the following rules.</p>
        <p>For hotels and serviced apartments, you are obliged to present a certification stating your status “tested – vaccinated – recovered” for every person from the age of 6.</p>
        <p>Permissible as proof of “tested – vaccinated – recovered” status are:</p>

        <h3 class="blue uppercase mt-5 mb-3">Tested</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Antigen rapid test from a doctor or authorised test centre - max. 48 hours old</li>
            <li>PCR test from a doctor or authorised test centre - max. 72 hours old</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="blue uppercase mt-5 mb-3">Vaccinated</h3>
        <p>COVID-19 vaccination:</p>
        <p class="bold">First vaccination received:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Min. 21 days have elapsed since the first vaccination, but no more than 90 days passed since the first vaccination.</li>
            <li>Given that a person had a positive molecular biological test for Covid-19 or evidence of neutralising antibodies at least 21 days prior to the vaccination, whereby the vaccination must not have been received more than 270 days ago.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Second vaccination received:</strong> not more than 270 days have passed since the vaccination.</p>
        <p><strong>Vaccination with vaccines for which only 1 vaccination is needed (e.g. Johnson & Johnson): </strong> 21 days have passed since the vaccination, but nor more than 270 days.</p>

        <h3 class="blue uppercase mt-5 mb-3">Recovered</h3>
        <p>Evidence of recovery of a covid-19 infection in the last 180 days or proof of evidence of neutralising antibodies not older than 90 days.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">We kindly ask you to upload the result of one of the above tests or proofs for EACH TRAVELLER under the link "TVR proof" in the e-mail (a photo of the document taken from the mobile phone is also sufficient).</p>
        <p class="mb-0">We understand that you may only be able to upload the test proofs at short notice due to the short validity period. If this applies to you, please inform us as we have to check each document individually for your protection and the protection of all other guests.</p>
        <p>A short email to <a href="mailto:office@jimmys.at" class="blue bold">office@jimmys.at</a> is sufficient.</p>

        <h3 class="blue uppercase mt-5 mb-3">Attention</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">If we do not receive your proof of test/vaccination in time before your arrival, your booking will be automatically cancelled under the normal cancellation conditions (free cancellation up to 3 days before arrival). In case of a positive Covid-19 test, your booking will of course be cancelled free of charge.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 class="my-5">What else is there to know?</h2>

        <h3>Check-in:</h3>
        <p>As soon as all documents have been uploaded and checked by us, you will automatically receive your access codes to the apartment by e-mail on the day of arrival in the morning. Your flat will be accessible with the code from 3pm onwards.</p>
        <h3>Check-out:</h3>
        <p>The codes to the apartment are valid until 12pm on the day of departure. Thanks to our contactless check-in procedure, a separate check-out is not necessary.</p>
        <h3>Early Check-in/ Late Check-out:</h3>
        <p>Are you arriving earlier or do you have to leave later than the standard check-in/out times? You are welcome to contact us directly regarding an early check-in or late check-out.</p>
        <p>Depending on the booking situation and the additional cleaning measures that take more time, we unfortunately cannot guarantee an early check-in or late check-out. However, we will do our best to fulfil your wishes. Should there be no availability, you have the possibility to lock your luggage safely in our luggage rooms. All you need to do is bring your own padlock.</p>
